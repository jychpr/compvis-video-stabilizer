# compvis-video-stabilizer
Computer Vision project for video stabilizer

Not perfect, but it works for some cases like simple video with focus on one object

Library requirements
- OpenCV
- Numpy

To run: just call/execute the python file (if I remembered correctly)

Note: User still need to change the video filename from a line in the python file if they wanted to process a video
